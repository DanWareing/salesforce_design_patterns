GoF Design Patterns applied to Salesforce

## Creational

_Abstract Factory_ - Allows the creation of objects without specifying their concrete type.  
_Builder_ - Uses to create complex objects.  
_Factory Method_ - Creates objects without specifying the exact class to create.  
_Prototype_ - Creates a new object from an existing object.  
_Singleton_ - Ensures only one instance of an object is created.

## Structural

_Adapter_ - Allows for two incompatible classes to work together by wrapping an interface around one of the existing classes.  
_Bridge_ - Decouples an abstraction so two classes can vary independently.  
_Composite_ - Takes a group of objects into a single object.  
_Decorator_ - Allows for an objectâ€™s behavior to be extended dynamically at run time.  
_Facade_ - Provides a simple interface to a more complex underlying object.  
_Flyweight_ - Reduces the cost of complex object models.  
_Proxy_ - Provides a placeholder interface to an underlying object to control access, reduce cost, or reduce complexity.

## Behaviour

_Chain of Responsibility_ - Delegates commands to a chain of processing objects.  
_Command_ - Creates objects which encapsulate actions and parameters.  
_Interpreter_ - Implements a specialized language.  
_Iterator_ - Accesses the elements of an object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.  
_Mediator_ - Allows loose coupling between classes by being the only class that has detailed knowledge of their methods.  
_Memento_ - Provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state.  
_Observer_ - Is a publish/subscribe pattern which allows a number of observer objects to see an event.  
_State_ - Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.  
_Strategy_ - Allows one of a family of algorithms to be selected on-the-fly at run-time.  
_Template Method_ - Defines the skeleton of an algorithm as an abstract class, allowing its sub-classes to provide concrete behavior.  
_Visitor_ - Separates an algorithm from an object structure by moving the hierarchy of methods into one object.
